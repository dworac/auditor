This is a template repository for quickly setting up a Node.js worker project with TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and more. It provides a foundation for developing and maintaining worker processes, enabling you to focus on the specifics of your task.

## Features

- **ESLint:** Use ESLint to catch and fix syntax and style errors early.
- **Jest:** Test your code with Jest, a powerful JavaScript testing framework.
- **esbuild:** Compile and bundle your code quickly with esbuild, a fast JavaScript bundler.
- **Husky:** Manage git hooks with Husky, automating tasks such as linting and testing.
- **nodemon:** Automatically restart your application when file changes in the directory are detected with nodemon.
